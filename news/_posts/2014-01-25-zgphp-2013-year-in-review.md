title: ZgPHP: 2013 year in review

Start of a new year is the best time to contemplate and summarize what was done
last year. This time we decided to write it down and share it with you. So, what
did we do in 2013?

In some sense, 2013 was a make it || break it year. With Ivan joining the ZgPHP
organization team we finally had time and resources to focus on some community
events outside of our regular monthly meetups.

In April && June we organized 2 workshops for developers interested in learning
new frameworks. The first was held by Maurizio Domba, a core Yii developer, and
taught us how to work with Yii. In the second, Antonio Perić did an introduction
to Symfony2. Both workshops were a total blast and we do plan to organize more
in future. There was a third workshop planned for the autumn of the 2013 but due
to our engagement with organizing two conferences we just didn’t have the time.

Yes, we organized two conferences in autumn of 2013. We decided to celebrate the
second anniversary of ZgPHP Meetups by organizing a [ZgPHP
conference](http://2013.zgphp.org/). This gave our fellow PHP developers outside
Zagreb a venue to meet. Since our monthly meetups are held on Thursdays
afternoons, a lot of developers living outside Zagreb are not able to attend or,
even better, to speak. With the help of 16 sponsors we were able to invite
speakers outside Zagreb, 4 from Serbia and 2 from Split. The conference was
attended by 110 visitors which was a great start. We hope to make this an annual
event.

The second conference was [WebCamp Zagreb](http://2013.webcampzg.org/), a web
development yet language agnostic conference organized by multiple user groups
based in Zagreb. This was the second WebCamp conference and with 600 visitors it
broke all expectations. There were 5 speakers from the PHP community, out of 24
in total, which was a nice change from having only one in 2012.

Both conferences were free of charge, but getting a free ticket was not an easy
thing as interest for them was enormous. ZgPHP meetup speakers received tickets
as a thank you and meetup attendees got hold of them rather easy. Another reason
to get involved, don’t you say?

Free tickets also meant that eventually somebody had to take care of the bills
so once again we would like to thank all of our sponsors for help, we would not
have been able to do it without you.

Besides organizing events in Zagreb we also organized a few field trips: [PHP
Srbija meetups](http://meetup.phpsrbija.rs/) in Belgrade && Novi Sad, and
[PHPDay](http://2013.phpday.it/) in Verona. [Luka
Kladarić](https://twitter.com/allixsenos) was one of speakers on PHPDay, while
[Miro Svrtan](https://twitter.com/msvrtan) and [Luka
Mužinić](https://twitter.com/lmuzinic) talked in Belgrade and Novi Sad
respectively.

As you can see we did a lot of things in 2013, but do not worry, we have plenty
ideas and fun projects in store for 2014, so stick around.
