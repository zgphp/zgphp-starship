#### Stipe Predanić – JadePHP templateing engine

JadePHP engine is based on Jade templating engine built for node.js, a
simplified version of haml. Stipe will cover engines
https://github.com/everzet/jade.php and https://github.com/sisoftrg/jade.php.

#### Lightning talks

If you are interested in speaking, lightning talks should last between 3 and 5
minutes, you can prepare slides or some code but don’t have to. This is a great
opportunity for all of our members to step up and talk! If you have a talk idea
already, contact us on `zgphpmeetup [at] gmail.com` to reserve a slot or just
contact us on the spot (during meetup)! Talks can be in either Croatian or
English, more about our announcement on using English can be found
[here](http://zgphp.org/2014/01/new-years-resolution-2014-zgphp-in-english/).
