title: New Years resolution 2014: ZgPHP in English
---

As you might have noticed on few of our last tweets and Facebook statuses, we
are starting to communicate in English only.

From now on, all tweets, facebook statuses, announcments, email notifications
etc will be written **in English only**. One thing that will be bilingual
(Croatian & English languages) is meetup itself. Hopefully this will change in
future too but we are not willing to force our speakers to use English if they
are not willing or feel they canâ€™t do it at nearly same quality.

There are many reasons for this change, most important one opening our PHP user
group to international speakers and audiences. We know that this is not a short
term project that will yield results quickly, our intention is to bring
international speakers to our monthly meetups as much as we want to make our
annual PHP conference a regular occurance.

We would like to take this opportunity to call all of our regular members and
fellow developers: contact us on `zgphpmeetup [at] gmail.com` if you are
interested in speaking on one of our next monthly meetups! We have some slots
opened from February on, you are the ones that can choose language of your talk.
